# ðŸŸ£ NovaPlay

## Welcome to NovaPlay

NovaPlay is the game store from the future where players discover great games, and developers find a censorship-resistant and developer-loyal distribution platform.&#x20;

NovaPlay solves the largest user experience and infrastructure problems facing both the players and developers of web3-enabled games. Through a rich in-game overlay with web3 features, NovaPlay improves the experience of playing games. Our in-game overlay features seamless wallet interactions powered by MetaMask and WalletConnect.&#x20;

NovaPlayâ€™s developer solutions are the easiest to adopt in the industry, from simple and optional wallet APIs to rich quest builders and smart contract factories. Game developers can interact with our APIs directly from Unity, Unreal, proprietary games engines, or window.ethereum for browser based games. Developers who prefer a no-code solution can leverage simple SDKs for both the Unreal and Unity game engines.

Unlike legacy game stores, NovaPlay aggregates other game stores like Epic Games, GOG, and Amazon Prime Gaming bringing the largest library and game discovery to players.&#x20;

Free from OS siloes, NovaPlay is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux and enables Windows games to be played on Mac and Linux. Browser-based games and dapps are supported too, and receive graphics card acceleration and our overlay when played through the NovaPlay app.\
