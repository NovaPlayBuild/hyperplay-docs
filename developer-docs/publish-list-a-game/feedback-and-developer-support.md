# ðŸ†˜ Feedback & Developer Support

If you have any questions, require assistance, or would like to provide us with your feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out to us via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/hyperplay) server or through the official communication channel we've set up with your team (Discord, Telegram, or Slack).&#x20;

When using our Discord server, we recommend that you connect with our Community Lead to ensure that you have the official **"NovaPlay Developer"** role, which will provide you with access to all the resources and support you need.

We're excited to see what you'll bring to the platform and look forward to supporting you on your journey.
