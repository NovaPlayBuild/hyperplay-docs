# ðŸ“› NovaPlay Store Badges

While NovaPlay doesn't charge anything to developers, adding a badge to your game's website is a requirement to be included in the NovaPlay Store. These badges help NovaPlay grow and are a great way to let your audience know your game is available on our platform.&#x20;

To ensure the proper use of our badges, please follow these guidelines:

* Use the badges from our [badge creator](https://www.novaplay.io/badges) or create your own!
* The badge must be large enough that all of the text is legible.
* The badge must be present wherever users download or launch the game. Linking to NovaPlay in a Partners section is appreciated, but is not sufficient to be included in the NovaPlay Store.
* There must be clear space surrounding the badge equal to one-quarter the height of the badge.
* The NovaPlay badge should be the same size or larger from other app store badges.

You can find our badges in the link below. We encourage you to use them on your website, social media, and other promotional materials. Using our badges, you can show your audience that your game is a part of the growing community of amazing games on the NovaPlay Store.

Thank you for choosing NovaPlay as your game distribution platform. We are committed to helping you reach a wider audience and providing players with the best gaming experience possible.
