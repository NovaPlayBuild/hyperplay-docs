# ðŸ•¹ API for Native Games

## Overview

NovaPlay is a web3-native game launcher with wallet integration. The launcher acts as a proxy between the desktop game and wallet. Any game on NovaPlay can trigger a wallet interaction with a simple HTTP request.

* Game triggers a HTTP request
* NovaPlay launcher receives the request and forwards it to the player's wallet
* If the player connected via MetaMask Mobile or WalletConnect, there will be a mobile popup
* If the player connected via MetaMask Extension, there will be an in game overlay
* The player can decide to approve or reject the transaction
