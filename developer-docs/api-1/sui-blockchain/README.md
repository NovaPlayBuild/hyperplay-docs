# Sui Blockchain

## Overview

Sui is a Layer 1 blockchain with a unique architecture.&#x20;

* Rather than accounts, Sui uses objects as it's basic unit of data storage. Objects can be owned, shared and transferred.&#x20;
* A single transaction can use outputs from an earlier call and used as an input to send a transaction. This can be done without deploying a new smart contract.
* Chain transactions are atomic meaning the transaction will execute completely or fail. This is convenient for applications with multiple actions.
